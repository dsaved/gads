# Google Africa Developer Scholarship Phase II (GADS 2020)

This project is a very simple Android Project aimed at getting you to implement some simple concepts that are very important as far as Android Development is concerned.

In this project, i have implemented a mobile design of the GADS 2020 Leaderboard.
The mobile App displays Top 20 learners in the Learning Leaders’ category and Top 20 learners in the Skill IQ Leaders’ category.


This project made me understand:

- Multi-Activity Project
- View pager
- Customizing Toolbar
- RecyclerView
- Making Network Request
- Working with Google Form and many more
